## Overview

Crawling, active scanning, authenticated scans and pipeline gating. In one line: dynamic application security testing decides where trust is placed, and misplaced trust is where the security problem lives. That's the theory you need — the understanding comes from doing it, so the walkthrough below is the heart of this chapter.

### How it works

Mechanically, dynamic application security testing comes down to three things: what data is trusted, where it crosses a boundary, and what happens on the other side. The diagram traces that path; you'll walk it for real, step by step, in the practice below.

```

<div class="card"><div class="card-title">🔑 Key terms</div>

- **Trust boundary** — where data or control passes between components of different privilege or trust.
- **Attack surface** — the set of points an attacker can interact with.
- **Primary control** — the single measure that most reduces this technique's impact.
- **Telemetry** — the log or signal a defender uses to detect the technique.

</div>

## Hands-On Practice

> [!TIP] This is the main event. Bring up the lab, then work the walkthrough — every command has a **▸ Run** button (needs the lab runner) and a **📋 Copy** button. ~48 min, Kali attacker, fully local.

```cf-lab
{"title": "Secure Development", "section": "09-secure-development", "targets": [["Kali / local shell", "everything you need is a terminal and the tools named per chapter"]], "compose": "# Optional scratch box for trying commands in isolation:\nservices:\n  scratch:\n    image: kalilinux/kali-rolling        # or debian:stable-slim\n    container_name: scratch\n    command: sleep infinity\n    networks: [labnet]\nnetworks:\n  labnet: { driver: bridge, internal: true }"}
```

Uses the [Secure Development lab environment](README.md#lab-environment).

### Guided walkthrough

<div class="stepper">

```cf-step
{"n": 1, "goal": "Provision & baseline", "cmd": "# bring up the part environment, then confirm you can reach `Kali / local shell` from Kali", "output": "Target reachable; you have a clean starting point.", "why": "Always capture 'normal' before you change anything — it's your reference.", "runnable": false}
```
```cf-step
{"n": 2, "goal": "Reproduce the technique", "cmd": "# perform the core dynamic application security testing technique step by step against Kali / local shell", "output": "You observe the expected effect and can repeat it reliably.", "why": "Owning the mechanism by hand beats running a tool you don't understand.", "runnable": false}
```
```cf-step
{"n": 3, "goal": "Observe what happened", "cmd": "# inspect logs / responses / process or network activity", "output": "You can point to exactly where and why it worked.", "why": "The evidence here is what a defender would alert on.", "runnable": false}
```
```cf-step
{"n": 4, "goal": "Apply the primary control", "cmd": "# implement the single most important fix for this technique", "output": "Repeating the technique now fails.", "why": "Fix the class, not the one payload — then prove it's closed.", "runnable": false}
```

### Try it yourself

> [!NOTE] Try each for real. Open the hint only when stuck, the solution only to check.

**Challenge 1.** Extend the walkthrough with one variation of the dynamic application security testing technique and predict the result before running it.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

Change one variable (payload, target, or control) at a time.

</details>
<details><summary>Solution</summary>

Answers vary — the goal is a correct prediction confirmed by observation.

</details>

**Challenge 2.** Find and apply a second defensive control for dynamic application security testing and show it also blocks the technique.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

Think in layers: prevention, detection, and least privilege.

</details>
<details><summary>Solution</summary>

Any independent control that breaks the chain counts — name why it works.

</details>

**Challenge 3.** Write a one-paragraph report of your dynamic application security testing test mapped to CWE/ATT&CK and the fix.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

Structure: finding → impact → evidence → remediation.

</details>
<details><summary>Solution</summary>

A defender should be able to act on your report without asking you anything.

</details>

### Detect & defend (blue-team view)

- Re-run the technique while watching your telemetry — attack and detection are two views of one event.
- Turn what you observed into a detection rule (Sigma/YARA) and confirm it fires without flooding.

### Skills check

You can move on when you can, without notes:

- [ ] Reproduce the core dynamic application security testing technique on demand against the lab.
- [ ] Explain the root cause and the single most effective control.
- [ ] Describe the telemetry a defender would use to catch it.

## Check Yourself

_Quick self-test — answers hidden. If you can't answer without notes, redo the relevant walkthrough step._

**Q1. In one sentence, what security problem does Dynamic Application Security Testing address or create?**

<details><summary>Show answer</summary>

Dynamic Application Security Testing matters because its behaviour determines where trust is placed; misplacing that trust is the root of the associated bug class.

</details>

**Q2. Name one trust boundary involved in Dynamic Application Security Testing and what crosses it.**

<details><summary>Show answer</summary>

Any point where attacker-influenced data meets privileged processing — e.g. user input reaching an interpreter, or a token reaching a verifier.

</details>

**Q3. Give one attack against Dynamic Application Security Testing and the single control that most reduces its impact.**

<details><summary>Show answer</summary>

State the attack precisely, then the *primary* control (validation, encoding, isolation, authentication, or least privilege) — not a laundry list.

</details>

**Interview angles**

- Walk me through how Dynamic Application Security Testing works, then tell me where you would attack it.
- How would you detect Dynamic Application Security Testing being abused in an environment you defend?
- What is the difference between mitigating and eliminating the risk associated with Dynamic Application Security Testing?

## Pitfalls & Best Practice

**Common mistakes**

- Treating dynamic application security testing as a checkbox instead of understanding the mechanism — defences copied without comprehension fail silently.
- Trusting client-side or default controls to enforce a server-side security property.
- Testing only the happy path and never the abuse cases or malformed input.
- Fixing the symptom (one payload) instead of the class (the missing control).

**Do this instead**

- Push security decisions to a single, well-tested enforcement point rather than scattering checks.
- Fail closed: when in doubt, deny and log, so misconfiguration reduces access rather than expanding it.
- Instrument the trust boundaries so the same event is visible to offence (as a target) and defence (as a signal).
- Validate your understanding of dynamic application security testing empirically in the lab before trusting it in production.
- Prefer safe, high-level APIs and secure defaults over hand-rolled primitives.

## Reference

- See [OWASP Top 10](../03-web-security/owasp-top-10.md) for the relevant category when this applies to web systems.

### CWE Mapping

- No direct weakness ID; when this concept fails in code it usually surfaces as one of the [CWE Top 25](../04-vulnerabilities/cwe-top-25.md) entries.

### CAPEC Mapping

- No single attack pattern; see the [CAPEC](../14-threat-intelligence/capec.md) chapter to map behaviour to patterns.

### CVE References

- No canonical CVE for a concept page. Search the [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) for concrete instances when studying real cases.

### NIST References

- [NIST CSRC Publications](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications) — search for the control family or guide relevant to this topic.

### RFC References

- No governing RFC for this topic. Where a protocol is involved, its RFC is linked from the relevant networking chapter.
